neutron stars: This article explores how twin neutron stars can coexist. The research finds important characteristics of nuclear equations of states that determine the mass range and maximum difference in radii for where neutron twins can coexist. This is done to understand the physics in extremely dense regions.

black holes: This article shows how colliding black holes causing a ringing which tells us attributes of the black holes. The new study adds evidence to Einstein's theories about relativity and Hawking's theories about black holes.

supernovae: Researchers created the largest Type Ia supernova dataset that suggests dark energy may evolve over time. If dark energy does change over time, it would mean changes in our current understand of physics, specfically Einstein's cosmological constant.

# You could use python to create a dictionary of information about the colliding black holes using the data of ringing.
